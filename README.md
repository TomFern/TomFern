👋 My name is Tomas Fernandez. I live in Porgugal, born in Argentina. Over my professional career, I’ve worn many hats: sysadmin, dba, and developer. I loved them all.

A few years ago, I needed a change and began freelancing. One thing led to another, and I found a passion for technical writing. After a few years of freelancing, I was fortunate enough to be offered a position as a full-time writer at [Semaphore](https://semaphore.io). This change would eventually shift my career to open source, which led to moving on to [Victoria Metrics](https://victoriametrics.com/blog/creating-a-sustainable-open-source-business-model/), where I currently work on a full-time basis as a technical writer.
